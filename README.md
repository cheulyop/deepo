# Deepo

This Docker image is modified from the [original Deepo image](https://github.com/ufoym/deepo) to use NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN image as a base (see [https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda)). This image includes:
* Ubuntu 18.04
* CUDA 11.0 and cuDNN 8
* Python 3.8
* Pytorch (latest)
* TensorFlow (latest)
* ONNX (latest)

Anyone can freely reuse/modify this repository. However, I strongly recommend that you refer to the original Deepo repository if you have questions or are interested in making additional changes.
